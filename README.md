# London Typescript Talks
A repo for organising talk proposals and discussing talks with speakers

## Talk Format
- Each event has 2-3 speaker slots available.
- Each talk is allocated 20 minutes, however, this can be altered on a per-case basis.
- We also welcome shorter lightning talks for quick dives on node.js topics - 5-10 minutes max.
- We only host live talks with speakers in the house (no video link ups)
- We prefer hands on demos and live code-in-practice or a developer story to tell over org charts, process diagrams, product demos or corporate promo material.
- This is the London _TypeScript_ Meetup Group - we are a broad group of developers and touch many technlogies in our day to day lives - but try and keep the link to TypeScript central to your talk.

## First time speakers
Our meetup is inclusive and friendly. If you need some speaking mentorship - we're here to help. Our organizers can provide a hand in multiple ways: Review your talk, provide tips & advice regarding public speaking, help with slides and general presentation.
How? Simply add a comment below your talk proposal (the github issue) that you're looking for some advice when you submit a talk.

## How
Its simple. [Open an issue](https://github.com/LondonTypescriptMeetup/speakers/issues/new/choose) to submit a talk.

## Confirmation
Once your issue is assigned a milestone, it has been approved and confirmed.

Code of conduct:
